> An interaction and fun bot for Telegram groups, having some useful and other useless commands.
> Created as an experiment and learning bot but being expanded and improved over time.

This repository contains the source code of [@PyKoroneBot](https://t.me/PyKoroneBot) Telegram bot, along with instructions for hosting your own instance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- A [Telegram API Key and API Hash](https://docs.pyrogram.org/intro/setup#api-keys).
- A [Telegram Bot Token](https://t.me/botfather).
- A Linux distribution (should also work on Windows but has not been tested).

## Installation

### Setup

First, clone this Git repository locally:
`git clone https://github.com/AmanoTeam/PyKorone`

After that, you can run `python3 -m pip install .` to install the bot along with the dependencies.

#### Error: `Directory '.' is not installable. File 'setup.py' not found.`

This common error is caused by an outdated version of pip. We use the Poetry
package manager to make things easier to maintain, which works with pip through
PEP-517. This is a relatively new standard, so a newer version of pip is necessary
to make it work.

Upgrade to pip 19 to fix this issue: `python3 -m pip install pip -U`

## Usage

To start the bot, type `python3 -m korone`, you can run the bot without updating its dependencies using `--no-update` as argument.
