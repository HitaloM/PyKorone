Bug Fixes

1.0.2 (2024-08-13)
==================

Features
--------

- If the bot is restricted to send messages in certain chats, it will now automatically leave those chats to avoid any problems.

Bug Fixes
---------

- We've made sure that if the bot runs into certain technical issues, it will handle them quietly without crashing.
- We fixed a connection issue that sometimes happened when interacting with Instagram, so the bot should connect more reliably now.
- We also corrected a problem where the bot might have crashed if it didnâ€™t receive a message as expected. Now, it will keep running smoothly.

1.0.1 (2024-08-12)
==================

Bug Fixes
