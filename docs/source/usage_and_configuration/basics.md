# The Basics

_PyKorone_ is designed for working in groups and private chats. It has numerous features that are organized into modules. Modules are simply a set of commands that are related to each other by functionality.

You can learn more about modules and the available modules in the [Modules](/modules/index) section. This guide will focus on the basis of using _PyKorone_.

## Invoking Commands

To interact with _PyKorone_, you must use commands. Commands are messages that start with a slash (`/`) or an exclamation mark (`!`) followed by the command name. For example, to check if _PyKorone_ is available, you can send the command `/start` or `!start`.

Commands can be used in both group and private chats. In group chats, you can optionally mention _PyKorone_ along with the command name to avoid conflicts with other bots. For example, you can use `/start@PyKoroneBot` to check the availability of _PyKorone_ without invoking the `/start` command of other bots.

## Learning Commands

Unlike other bots, _PyKorone_ does not have a help menu with all available commands. Instead, you can use the [Modules](/modules/index) section to learn about the available commands. Each module has a list of commands that are related to a specific functionality.
