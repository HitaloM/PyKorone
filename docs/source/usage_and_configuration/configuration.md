# Configurations

PyKorone has several commands that allow you to configure it to your liking. You can change the bot's language, disable unwanted commands, and more, which can be found using the `/help` command.

## Changing the Bot's Language

You can change the bot's language by using the `/language` command. This command will show you the current language of the bot along with a button to change it.

```{warning}
In groups, only admins can change the bot's language!
```

```{note}
PyKorone automatically detects your language based on your Telegram client settings. If your language is not available, it will default to English.
```

## Disabling and Enabling Commands

You can disable and enable commands in groups by using the `/disable` and `/enable` commands. These commands allow you to disable and enable commands for the entire group.

1. To disable a command, use the `/disable` command followed by the command you want to disable. For example: `/disable afk`.
2. To enable a command, use the `/enable` command followed by the command you want to enable. For example: `/enable afk`.

```{note}
You can see a list of all available commands that can be disabled or enabled by using the `/disableable` command.
```
