# Configurations

_PyKorone_ has several commands that allow you to configure the bot's behavior.

## Changing the Bot's Language

You can change the bot's language by using the `/language` command. This command will show you the current language of the bot along with a button to change it.

```{warning}
In groups, only admins can change the bot's language!
```

```{note}
_PyKorone_ automatically detects your language based on your Telegram client settings in private chats during the first interaction. If the bot doesn't support your language, it will default to English.
```

## Disabling and Enabling Commands

You can disable and enable commands in groups by using the `/disable` and `/enable` commands. These commands allow you to disable and enable commands for the entire group. For more information, see the [Disabling](/modules/disabling) module section of the documentation.

## And More
