# Stickers

The stickers module provides commands to manage stickers and sticker packs on Telegram.

## Commands

- `/kang (?emoji)`: "Steals" the sticker from the replied message and adds it to a new sticker set or an existing one. If you provide the `emoji` argument, the bot will use it as the sticker's emoji.

```{note}
Currently, the `/kang` command only supports adding stickers to sticker packs created by the bot. You can't add stickers to other people's sticker packs or to sticker packs you created manually.
```

```{tip}
- The `/kang` command can be used in reply to images and videos as well.
- You can view, edit and delete sticker packs created by _PyKorone_ in the official Telegram [Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers) bot.
```
