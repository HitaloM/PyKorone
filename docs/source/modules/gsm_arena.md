# GSM Arena

Obtaining smartphone specifications can be a tedious task, especially when it involves navigating through multiple websites or pages.

This module simplifies the process by enabling users to obtain the specifications of a particular device directly from Telegram using data from [GSM Arena](https://www.gsmarena.com/).

## Commands

- `/d (device name)`: Gets the specifications for "device name" from GSM Arena.

After receiving this command, the bot will search GSM Arena for the given device name. If multiple devices match the query, the bot will present a list from which you can select the specific device you're interested in. For unique device names that return a single match, the bot will directly display the specifications of that device.
