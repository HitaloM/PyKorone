# GSM Arena

Obtaining smartphone specifications can be a tedious task, especially when it involves navigating through multiple websites or pages.

This module simplifies the process by enabling users to obtain the specifications of a particular device directly from Telegram using data from [GSM Arena](https://www.gsmarena.com/).

## Commands

- `/d (device name)`: When you provide the name of a device, the bot will search for it on GSM Arena and return a list of devices matching the search query. You can then select a device from the list to view its specifications. Or if the device is unique, the bot will directly display its specifications.
