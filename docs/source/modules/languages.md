# Languages

Not every group speaks fluent english; some groups would rather have _PyKorone_ respond in their own language.

This is where translations come in; you can change the language of the bot's replies to be in the language of your choice!

## Commands

- `/language`: Displays the current language of the bot in the chat.
- `/languages`: Displays a list of all available languages. To set a new language, just click on the button corresponding to the language you want.

```{warning}
In groups, only admins can change the language of the bot.
```

## Contribute to Translations

Help make _PyKorone_ available in your language by contributing translations via Weblate. You can access the project [here](https://weblate.amanoteam.com/projects/korone/korone/).

```{note}
Weblate translations are added to the bot with each new update.
```
