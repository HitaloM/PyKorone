# Users

With this module you can get information about bot users, remove deleted accounts from groups, and more.

## Commands

- `/user (?user)`: Returns information about a user. If no user is specified, it returns information about the user who sent the command.
- `/id`: Returns the ID of the user who sent the command, or the group to which the command was sent. Can also be used to get a user's ID by replying to a message from that user.
- `/cleanup`: Removes deleted accounts from the group where the command was sent.
