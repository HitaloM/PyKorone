# Disabling

Not everyone wants every feature Korone offers. Some commands are best left unused to prevent spam and abuse.

This allows you to disable some commonly used commands so that no one can use them.

## Commands

- `/disable (commandname)`: Disable user from using the "commandname" command.
- `/enable (commandname)`: Enable user to use the "commandname" command.
- `/disableable`: List all commands that can be disabled.
- `/disabled`: List all commands that are currently disabled.

````{note}
This module is only available for groups.

```{attention}
Only users with the `administrator` permission can disable commands.
```
