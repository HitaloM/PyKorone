Some websites, when their links are shared on Telegram, do not display a preview of the content. This module solves this problem by automatically downloading the media content from these websites and displaying it in the chat.

```{note}
**Automatic media download is available for the following websites**:
- X (Twitter)
- TikTok
```

## Commands

- `/ytdl (?URL)`: Download a video or audio from YouTube. You can
also omit the link and reply to a message containing a YouTube URL.
