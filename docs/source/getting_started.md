## Adding to Your Group

_PyKorone_ is designed to work in groups and private chats. To add it to your group, follow these steps:

### Instructions

1. Open your Telegram client of choice.
2. Do a user search for `@PyKoroneBot` (see note below).
3. View the bot's profile, click the 3-dot menu in the top right corner, and select the `Add to Group` option. Then choose your group.

Congratulations! _PyKorone_ is now in your group.

```{attention}
During step 2, you may see other bots or users with similar names or usernames. Make sure you only add the bot with the username `@PyKoroneBot`, as others are imposters!
```

### Alternative Instructions

If you're having trouble adding _PyKorone_ to your group, you can use the following link to add it to your group: [t.me/PyKoroneBot?startgroup=true](https://t.me/PyKoroneBot?startgroup=true).

```{admonition} Note: For Mobile Devices
:class: note

If you're on your mobile device, the link should open your Telegram client to select the chat you wish to add _PyKorone_ to.
```

```{admonition} Note: For PC
:class: note

If you're on a PC, you need to have Telegram Desktop installed. When the link opens in your browser, Telegram will ask you to allow it to open the link. Select "allow," and when Telegram opens, you should get a prompt to choose which group you'd like to add _PyKorone_ to.
```

## Granting Admin Rights (Optional)

To use _PyKorone_ in groups, you don't need to give it admin rights, but it's recommended to do so to avoid some Telegram limitations. To give _PyKorone_ admin rights, follow these steps:

### Instructions

1. Click the banner at the top of your group to view your group's information.
2. Click the pencil icon to edit your group's settings.
3. Click "Administrators," and then "Add Administrator."
4. Select `@PyKoroneBot` from the list of users.
5. Grant it all the admin rights available, and click the checkmark icon to confirm.

Congratulations! _PyKorone_ now has admin rights in your group.
