## Adding to Your Group

To add _PyKorone_ to your group, follow these steps:

### Instructions

1. Open your Telegram client of choice.
2. Do a user search for `@PyKoroneBot` (see note below).
3. View the bot's profile, and select the `Add to Group or Channel` option. Then choose your group.

```{attention}
During step 2, you may see other bots or users with similar names or usernames. Make sure you only add the bot with the username `@PyKoroneBot`, as others are imposters!
```

You can also open the following link to add _PyKorone_ to your group automatically: [t.me/PyKoroneBot?startgroup=true](https://t.me/PyKoroneBot?startgroup=true).

2. Click the pencil icon to edit your group's settings.
3. Click "Administrators," and then "Add Administrator."

5. Grant it all the admin rights available, and click the checkmark icon to confirm.
