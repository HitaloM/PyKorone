{# This is a heavily customised version of towncrier's default template. #}

{#-
  Only render if there's any changes to show.

  This serves as a compatibility "hack" since we render unreleased news entries
  in our changelog with ``sphinxcontrib.towncrier``; which triggers a render even
  when there's no entries to be rendered.
#}
{% if sections[''] %}

{#- Heading for individual version #}
{{ versiondata.version }} ({{ versiondata.date }})
{{ top_underline * ((versiondata.version + versiondata.date)|length + 3) }}
{#
  The following loop will run exactly once, with ``section_name == ""``.

  This is due to the undocumented "sections" feature in towncrier.
  See https://github.com/twisted/towncrier/issues/61.

  We don't use this feature, and this template doesn't render the section
  heading for that reason.
