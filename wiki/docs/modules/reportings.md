With Reports, all members can inform admins about an incident by replying to a message.

## Available commands
- `/report (?text)`: Reports the replied-to message
@admins: Same as above, but not a clickable
Once a user replied with `/report` or `@admins` to a problematic message, Sophie will notify all admins of the report.

:information_source: You always can disable reporting by disabling module
