The connection module in SophieBot allows users to manage their chat connections privately via personal messages (PM). This feature helps prevent spam in group chats by handling administrative tasks directly in PMs. Below are the primary commands and functionalities available to end-users for managing connections.

## Available commands
- `/connect`: if in group - automatically connects the user's PM to the current chat.
- `/connect`: if in pm - shows recent connected groups buttons
- `/connect (group ID)`: Connects the user to a specific chat using its chat ID. The chat ID must be provided as an argument.
- `/allowusersconnect (enable / disable)`: Allows or disallows other users to connect to the chat.
