The Purges module helps you delete certain messages or a range of them.

## Available commands
- `/purge`: Deletes all messages from the message you replied to, up to the current message
- `/del`: Deletes the message you replied to, and also your "/del" command message

:warning: **Warning:** Telegram does not allow bots to delete messages older than 48h.
Deleting / purging messages older than this will not work. Please do this manually.
